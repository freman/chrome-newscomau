Tweaks for news.com.au


WTF?
----------------

news.com.au annoyed me, so I started this plugin for chrome/chromium.

What's it do?
----------------

Right now it permanently disables the autoplay function on videos (because turning off autoplay on every other view was beginning to annoy me)

I'll add more features as I get annoyed by the site, or as others suggest
